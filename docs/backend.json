This path-based ownership ensures that only the authenticated user can access their own data. The `id` field within the UserAccount document is redundant given the path structure and could be omitted for simplicity. The orderIds array stores references to order documents. Orders could be stored as a subcollection of UserAccount (`/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`), or in a top-level `orders` collection, depending on whether orders need to be accessed independently of user accounts. If stored in a top-level `orders` collection, the UserAccount data would need to be denormalized with the `userId` to allow secure listing of orders by user."
