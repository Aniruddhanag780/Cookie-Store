/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All data
 * is organized under a user's unique ID, and access is restricted to the
 * authenticated owner of that data. This provides strong security and privacy by default.
 *
 * Data Structure: The database is structured around a top-level 'users' collection.
 * Each user's data is stored in a document where the document ID is the user's
 * Firebase Authentication UID. For example: /users/{userId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users can only read and write their own data within their
 *   document tree (/users/{userId}). They cannot access, or even know about,
 *   the data of other users.
 * - No Public User Listing: Listing all documents in the '/users' collection is
 *   explicitly disabled to protect user privacy and prevent data scraping.
 * - Path & Data Consistency: Rules enforce that the 'id' field within a user's
 *   document must match their UID in the path upon creation, and that this ID
 *   is immutable, ensuring relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The primary authorization mechanism is
 * "path-based ownership." The user's UID is used directly as the document ID,
 * which is the most efficient way to secure user-specific data without needing
 * extra database reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Not currently applicable as the data model consists
 * of a single collection. If public and private user data were introduced, the
 * recommended pattern would be to use separate collections.
